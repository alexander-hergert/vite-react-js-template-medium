# Template for React Vite setup with JavaScript

This is the setup I use for medium React projects in JavaScript.
The projects have multiple pages and prefered way for fetching is React Query.

## This template uses following setups

- Please remove the .git file by using command "rm -rf .git"
- Then use "git init" again
- Then "npm install" or "yarn install"
- Then "npm update" or "yarn upgrade"

#### [useReducer](https://react.dev/reference/react/useReducer)

- Prepared useReducer in the context.jsx (Organize your logic using a reducer to change the state. Make immutable changes!)

You can run tests by using ("npm run test" or "yarn test" depending on your package manager).

What you don't need you can remove and ofcourse install more dependencies which you might need for sure ðŸ˜Š
I hope this might inspire you to create your own template which you can keep on modifying and ofcourse create different variants.

Happy coding!
